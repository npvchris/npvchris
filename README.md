👋 Hello, I'm @npvchris!

- 👀 I'm interested in web development, mobile app development, and artificial intelligence.
  
- 🌱 Currently, I'm learning JavaScript for web development, Kotlin for Android app development, and Python for AI and data analysis.

- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on software development projects that allow me to apply and expand my skills, especially in teams where I can learn from other experienced developers.

- 📫 You can reach me via my email npvchris@proton.me or through my GitHub profile: github.com/npvchris.

- 😄 Pronouns: He/him.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Besides programming, I'm also passionate about motorcycles and love playing the guitar in my free time to relax.
